A collection of all of my java work throughout college, to give an idea of the work i've done in the language, all of these projects are from my time at UMD, so they contain portions of source code provided by the instructors.

This code is purely for the perusal of potential employers, any student that uses my solution or copies this code is resposible for the academic repercussions their plagiarism may have. Do not use this code to cheat on your assignments.
